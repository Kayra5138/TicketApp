# TicketApp
I developed this mobile application for the Pervasive Computing course at Sannio university.

I developed this mobile application in Android Studio. I mostly used the Java programming language. The application allows the user to register and log in; see current events and buy tickets; allows users to view and cancel their own tickets and view the QR codes of the relevant tickets. At the same time, login-registration and event information are kept in a database.
